# System Architecture

## Overview
The AI Trading System consists of three main components communicating through REST APIs and message queues.

## Components

### C++ Backend (High Performance)
- Market data ingestion and processing
- Real-time sentiment analysis
- Low-latency signal processing
- Message queue management

### Python Engine (Intelligence)
- Trading strategy implementation
- Machine learning model training and inference
- Portfolio optimization and risk management
- Backtesting and performance analysis

### Swift iOS App (Interface)  
- Portfolio visualization and management
- Real-time trading signals display
- User preferences and configuration
- Push notifications and alerts

## Data Flow
1. C++ Backend ingests market data from multiple sources
2. Sentiment analysis processes news and social media
3. Python Engine receives processed data and generates trading signals
4. iOS App displays signals and manages user portfolio
5. Trading decisions flow back through the system

## Communication
- **REST APIs**: Configuration and status updates
- **WebSockets**: Real-time data streaming
- **Redis**: Message queue and caching
- **PostgreSQL**: Persistent data storage
